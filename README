ProxyNode is a simple HTTP Proxy that has few out-of-the-box features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll need Node.JS installed to run it. Get it at www.nodejs.org, then 
compile and install:

    $ ./configure
    $ make && make install

Then simply run the script.

    $ node ProxyNode.js

You can blacklist host by a regex pattern. Simply put any host's
name into the .blacklist file inside of the proxy directory:

    $ echo 'example.com' >> ./.blacklist

There may be more features to come, however, it is an open source project! So,
if you are so inclined to, please do contribute. It is much appreciated.
